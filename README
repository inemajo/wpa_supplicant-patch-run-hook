WHY?:
There no simply way to use wpa_supplicant events. With this patch, in every
events of wpa_supplicant it may call a hook script and it passing in
environnement variables infos of current state.

The env variables are :

always:

     -WPAS_IFNAME (interface name)
     -WPAS_STATE (event state like WPA_COMPLETED,WPA_SCANNING...)

when WPA_COMPLETED state:
     -WPAS_SSID (ssid of completed ap)
     -WPAS_REAUTH (0 no, 1 yes)
     -WPAS_ID (number of list id selectionned in wpa_supplicant.conf)
     -WPAS_MAC (mac of completed ap)


In the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf you just add in global variable:

event_cmd=/full-directory-path-of-script/script
