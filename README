##     Tested on: 
##			wpa_supplicant v0.7.3 - (kernel 3.X with (and not) selinux)
## !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


WHY?:
There are no simply way (using wpa_cli has a daemon isn't satisfying) to use wpa_supplicant events. With this patch, in every
events of wpa_supplicant it may call a hook script and it passing in
environnement variables infos of current state.

-----

The env variables are :

always:

     -WPAS_IFNAME (interface name)
     -WPAS_STATE (event state like WPA_COMPLETED,WPA_SCANNING...)

when COMPLETED state:
     -WPAS_SSID (ssid of completed ap)
     -WPAS_REAUTH (0 no, 1 yes)
     -WPAS_ID (number of list id selectionned in wpa_supplicant.conf)
     -WPAS_MAC (mac of completed ap)

when ASSOCIATING state:
     -WPAS_SSID
     -WPAS_MAC (BUT IT'S ALWAYS 00:00:00:00:00 !!)

-------

In the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf you just add in global variable:

event_cmd=/full-directory-path-of-script/script
